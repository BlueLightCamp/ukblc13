Open Data
=========

Here is a collection of open data that might be useful material for the hackathon. Of course you are not limited by these sources and may use whatever data you choose.

Please feel free to send us more sources to update this list.

Police API
----------

The Police API allows you to retrieve information about neighbourhood areas in all 43 English & Welsh police forces and for the Police Service of Northern Ireland. All forces are required to keep this data accurate and up to date, so the API provides a rich and definitive data source
